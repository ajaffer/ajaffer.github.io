  <main>
    <p>I designed and built a self-driving RC car platform to explore real-time perception and control using embedded compute. This hands-on side project helped me better understand how machine learning models interact with physical systems and what trade-offs exist when deploying them on constrained hardware.</p>

    <p>The project was built using the open-source <a href="https://www.donkeycar.com/" target="_blank">DonkeyCar platform</a>, a well-known framework for autonomous RC vehicles. I followed the base setup to get started quickly, then made modifications to the training loop, camera mount, and control logic to experiment with onboard inference and improve driving stability.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Perception Stack:</strong> Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) using behavioral cloning to predict steering angles from camera input.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware Platform:</strong> Used a Raspberry Pi 3 with a camera module for onboard processing and real-time control.</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment Experience:</strong> Tuned parameters and processing pipeline to run live inference on the Pi and iterated based on track performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Exploration Areas:</strong> Experimented with data augmentation and custom driving modes to improve generalization and robustness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project was a deep dive into practical ML deployment on edge devices and gave me valuable insight into the challenges of real-time decision-making, perception reliability, and hardware limitations. It also sparked my interest in systems where safety and autonomy intersect â€” such as fleet safety and ADAS platforms.</p>
